# mine-basher

## What is **mine-basher**
*mine-basher* is my recreation of the popular game *Mine Sweeper*, but using only the programming language *bash*, that you can run in your linux command line.
This is the follow-up project to my [snash](https://github.com/forgottosave/snash)-game and who knows, maybe a small series of bash-games :)



## ~Install and Run~
Currently this game is work-in-progress and not playable, yet!

## How to Play
You find the general information when adding the flag `-h` when executing the program. Still here are some explanations:

**Goal**
  - Find all the mines hidden in the sea, but be careful: a wrong action might get you exploded!
  - Have fun!

**Controls**
Key | Description
--|--
w,a,s,d | cursor movement (or, as requested by a dear friend: h,j,k,l)
e,1 | mark area as safe
q,2 | mark potential mine
